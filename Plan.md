## 🧰 Extra Tips for LeetCode Usage

- Bookmark problems you fail. Revisit after 1 week.  
- Write C++ code cleanly. Use comments to explain logic.  
- Use Discuss tab after solving to see other optimal approaches.  
- Maintain a Notion or Excel sheet to track problems, status (solved, unsolved), date.
